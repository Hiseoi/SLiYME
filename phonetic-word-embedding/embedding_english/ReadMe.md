# English Phonetic Embeddings

## Preparing environment

```bash
cd embedding_english
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Creating the cython package

Create it using the make.

```bash
make build
```

We can test whether it's build sucessfully or not.

```bash
make test
```

## Training Embedding

```bash
make train
```

This will generate the `simvecs` file. For running it manually see options by running

```bash
python train.py -h
```

You can also use the pre-trained vector embedding.

```bash
cp ../vector_embeddings/simvecs ./
```

## Results

To see the embedding results check [result.ipynb](result.ipynb)

## TSNE Plot

The TSNE plot for some of the words can be generated by [tsne.ipynb](tsne.ipynb)
